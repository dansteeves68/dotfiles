# Dan's macOS dotfiles

Relies on jbernard/dotfiles for syncing some darwin-configuration.nix. (May be overkill given I want to manage as much as possible in one dotfile.)

## Bootstrap a new Mac

After first time, this is my best guess at repeating the bootstrap.

- Install nix
- Install nix-darwin
- Update darwin-configuration.nix to get everything installed, including dotfiles
- Clone this
- Run dotfiles -s

## Todo

- Sublime Text Packages and Settings
